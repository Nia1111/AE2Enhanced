# Advanced ME Omni Tool

The <ItemLink id="me_omni_tool" /> **Advanced ME Omni Tool** is a network-bound multi-tool. Bind it to your network in an ME security terminal before use.

## Modes

Four modes, cycled with **N**:

- **Universal**: general mining and combat.
- **Placement**: places blocks from the network; middle-click picks the targeted block as preset, **G** opens the radial preset menu, Shift+wheel toggles single/batch placement.
- **Rotate**: rotates blocks.
- **Travel**: blink/teleport movement, up to 256 blocks (config `omniTool.maxBlinkDistance`); wall phasing is enabled by default.

## Keys

- **N**: cycle mode. **Shift+N**: toggle silk touch (with an "advanced silk" option that preserves block NBT).
- **Ctrl+N**: cycle drop mode: normal drops, straight to inventory, or straight to the ME network (requires binding by Shift+right-clicking a Wireless Channel Transmitter).
- **C**: open the config GUI.

## Combat

- Base attack damage 6.0 as true damage (bypasses armor, config `omniTool.baseAttackDamage`).
- Entities hit are marked with an anti-heal flag that blocks healing.

## Upgrades

- **Chaos Core** (requires Draconic Evolution): enables chaos damage and force-kill.
- **Bedrock Breaker**: allows breaking bedrock.
- **Fortune** levels, and other enchantments can be imported from enchanted books.
- **Travel Staff**: prerequisite of Travel mode; can bind a travel anchor.
- **Conformal Invariant Charge**: unlocks its dedicated handler. See [Black Hole Crafting](systems/black-hole.md).

Break cooldown caps at 20 ticks; unbreakable blocks can be blacklisted in config.
